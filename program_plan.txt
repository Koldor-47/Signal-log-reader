Reading Signal Logger File

need to setup info on the item logged, ie the ID, Alias, If logging on a Time or event

    * Setup a signal Object for each signal logged
        ID, Alias, wayOfrecording, list of -> (time + value)
        
        Log Types
        AnalogSignalPeriodicLogger
        AnalogSignalPeriodicSampleLogger
        DigitalSignalChangeLogger
    
    * problem -> the block of values isn't logged at he same time 1-3 milli seconds different
        - maybe try reading as each time block first instead of each row seperate DataClass ??

then need to read through the siglog file and match the right id, time and data logged.
    * group all the time based event ones together on the same time.
    * add in the Event based Ones as they happen.
    * add the data to each seperate signal (Time, Value)

for for output need al data points on 1 line, items logged per a time can share the same time a long as its not too far away
    * pandas seems to like a list of dicts instead of a class with a list of values - 
        Merage with out join could work on the peroid sig to the event based ones
